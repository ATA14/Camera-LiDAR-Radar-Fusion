# Camera-LiDAR-Radar-Fusion
This Projects Contain data level fusion of camera+LiDAR and camera+radar

There are many sensors that are important for a self driving vehicle, but the most important sensors used for path planning and decision making are camera, LiDAR, and Radar. Each of these sensors are used for differnet functionality and pairing some of them togther provides a more complete system the vehicle can use for making decisions. Cameras are the most commnly used modality for the function of object detction, LiDAR is the best sensor to use when calcultaing distances and depth, and radars are the most reliable sensor to calculate velocity of objects even in the most adherse weather conditions.
